## Innovative Idea

Our application is a multipurpose utility program for farmers to use to connect to other farmers in their area, view their produce, view average produce prices in their area, and more. It will allow farmers to manage their farm-related tasks and is more oriented towards smaller-scale farmers.

Currently, there are applications for farmers to manage specific things such as water or electricity usage. However, our application will cater specifically to linking small business-owners for the purpose of facilitating farmersâ€™ markets.

## Important Components
Oriented toward small business farms.
Important components include communication between farmers.  This would include messaging and forum posting between farmers.  We also want to form crop coordination channels between farmers so that they can communicate about the crops they are bringing to the farmers market to provide more crop diversity for consumers.  We also want an off-season crop coordination app so that farmers can communicate.
